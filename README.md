### 'HEllO_ALFRED'
We have Siri for our phone and Alexa for our home.
But What about our desktop? Ever since I saw the movie 'The Batman' and 'The Ironman',
I've always wanted my own personal AI butler with gorgeous English accent!
Alfred lives inside your desktop to keep your schedule tidy, alert you and cheer you on!
