### 'HEllO_ALFRED'
I wanted to explore the idea of AI and machine learning with TensorFlow speech command.

*Tensorflow Speech command
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/speech-commands

0. Import Dependencies 
1. Create Model and Action states 
2. Create recognizer 
3. Create list for Actions 
4. Display commands 
5. Train the butler to use more words
6. Execution of commands
7. Set up replies ( possibly with English accent, because WHY THE HELL NOT?)

You can train your own AI using below link.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
